"@jmfederico/pi-web": patch
---

Add a dedicated PI WEB configuration reference covering config-file precedence, project-local config, external path access allowlists, session daemon tools, plugins, shortcuts, upload limits, and environment variables. Custom `pi-web install --config` paths are now passed to the session daemon service as well as the web service, and the session daemon now honors config-file `maxUploadBytes` values.
